Password Creation and Strength Evaluation

## Overview
This demonstrates understanding of password strength, complexity, and best practices in cybersecurity. Multiple passwords of varying complexity were created and evaluated using leading online password strength tools. The results were analyzed for strength and security, with recommendations for best practices based on expert guidance.

## Contents
- `passwords`: Sample passwords with varying complexity.
- `analysis`: Summary and explanations for password strength results, common password attacks, and security tips.
- `screenshots`: (Screenshots of each password being tested on password meters.)
- `README.md`: This document explains the approach and findings.

## Highlights

- Tested password examples ranging from weak ("password", "1234567890") to very strong ("L0ng&ComplexP@ssw0rd2025$").
- Summarized feedback from password strength evaluation tools.
- Identified key attacks: brute force, dictionary, credential stuffing, etc.
- Explained how length, complexity, and unpredictability affect security.
- Compiled best practices: long, unique, and unpredictable passwords, use of managers, and passphrases.
- Demonstrated awareness of modern security standards (focus on length, uniqueness, and usability).

## Key Learnings

- Length is the most important factor: aim for 12â€“16+ characters.
- Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
- Avoid common words, patterns, and predictable substitutions.
- Use passphrases for memorability and strength.
- Deploy password managers for secure, unique password storage.
- Activate multi-factor authentication wherever possible.
