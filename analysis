Password Strength Testing Results (using Password Strength Checkers)

Method: Each password was tested on reputable password strength checkers like Passwordmonster, Bitwarden, and Passwordmeter.

Typical Evaluation Criteria:
•	Length: The longer the password, the stronger it is.
•	Character Variety: Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
•	Unpredictability: Avoids dictionary words, patterns, and personal info.
•	Time to Crack: Estimated (from minutes to billions of years).

Example Summary Table
| Password                     | Length | Complexity                  | Estimated Strength   | Feedback (Typical)                   |
|------------------------------|--------|-----------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| password                     | 8      | None                        | Very Weak            | Easily guessed; dictionary word      |
| Password123                  | 11     | Upper, lower, digit         | Very Weak            | Slightly better; still common        |
| Pass123!                     | 8      | Upper, lower, digit, symbols| Very Weak            | Too short; could improve further     |
| StrongPass#2025!             | 15     | Upper, lower, digit, symbols| Strong               | Good length; good character mix      |
| L0ng&ComplexP@ssw0rd2025$    | 24     | Full variety                | Very Strong          | Exceptional; hard to crack           |
| 1234567890                   | 10     | Digits only                 | Very Weak            | Sequential; easily guessed           |
| P@$$w0rd!                    | 9      | Substitution, symbols       | Very Weak            | Looks strong; still predictable      |

Most checkers flagged "password", "1234567890" as weak, while long and complex options like "L0ng&ComplexP@ssw0rd2025$" were rated "Exceptional" or "Very Strong".

Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords
•	Length trumps complexity: Aim for at least 12-16 characters; longer is much harder to crack.
•	Mix it up: Use randomness; mix uppercase, lowercase, symbols, and numbers.
•	Avoid dictionary words: Don’t use words, names, dates, or obvious substitutions (like Password123 or qwerty).
•	Unpredictability: Don’t use patterns, sequences, or personal data.
•	Unique per account: Never reuse passwords across sites and apps.
•	Use password managers: They support creating, storing, and filling strong, unique passwords for you.
•	Consider passphrases: Multiple unrelated random words (HorsePurpleHatRunBayLifting) are both strong and memorable.

Key Tips Learned from Evaluation
•	Password meters penalize use of common words, patterns, and short length.
•	Leet-speak (e.g. P@$$w0rd) doesn't provide much protection.
•	The most value comes from length and unpredictability; even simple patterns with symbols are easy for attackers.
•	Password managers and passphrases are recommended by experts for security and usability.

Common Password Attacks Explained
•	Brute force: Tries every possible combination; longer and more complex passwords resist this.
•	Dictionary attack: Tries common words and simple variations; easily defeats “password” or “letmein”.
•	Credential stuffing: Uses leaked username/password combos from other breaches; password reuse is a risk.
•	Password spraying: Tries common passwords on many accounts to avoid detection.
•	Rainbow table: Uses precomputed hash tables for cracking; salt prevents this.
•	Keylogger: Malware records your keystrokes to steal passwords.
•	Phishing: Tricks you into revealing passwords via fake sites or messages.
•	Man-in-the-middle: Intercepts your communication for passwords, especially on unsafe networks.

How Password Complexity Affects Security
•	Long, unique, unpredictable passwords drastically increase time and resources needed for attacks.
•	Complexity increases search space—making brute force attacks infeasible.
•	Avoiding dictionary words/patterns defeats dictionary and pattern-based attacks.
•	Password managers make it possible to use complex and unique passwords easily for every account.
